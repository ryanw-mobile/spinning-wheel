This is a simple toy app with a spinning wheel.

I saw something similar in an App, and thought it should not be too difficult to make one using
Jetpack Compose.

I am open to try something fun in this App. If you have any new idea to make this app more
interesting, feel free to talk to me, and contribute via pull requests!
